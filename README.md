Vaccinate-Me is an unofficial app which can help you find appointment availabilty and download vaccination certificates.
It uses Co-WIN Public APIs provided by API Setu to fetch data about the slots on selected date. For making API Calls, I have used volley Library.

As per the new API guidelines :
  
The appointment availability data is cached and may be upto 5 minutes old.

Co-WIN Public APIs
  
[API Setu](https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin)

</h3>

Co-WIN Public APIs allow any third-party application to access certain un-restricted information, that can be shared with its users. This is limited only to read access in Co-WIN. The extent of access will be limited and in case of any misuse impacting the performance of Co-WIN solution will result in blocking any such application and entities as per the policies of MoHFW and taking any other appropriate action in accordance with law. The appointment availability data is cached and may be up to 5 minutes old. Further, these APIs are subject to a rate limit of 100 API calls per 5 minutes per IP.
